# About this repository
A cardioid is a two-dimensional plane figure that has a heart-shaped curve. The word *cardioid* originated from a Greek word, which means *heart*. By what it looks like, it's easy to see why it's called a heart-shaped curve. 

This repository was humourously named *the-heart-of-mathematics* as a nod to the cardioid being heart shaped and in dedication to my dearly beloved Juno. I love you with all my heart and I'm never letting you go. All my love chellams!
