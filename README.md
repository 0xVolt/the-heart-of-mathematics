# About this repository
## Dedication
This repository was humourously named *the-heart-of-mathematics* as a nod to the cardioid being heart shaped and in dedication to my dearly beloved Juno. I love you with all my heart and I'm never letting you go. All my love chellams!

## What is a cardioid
A cardioid is a two-dimensional plane figure that has a heart-shaped curve. The word *cardioid* originated from a Greek word, which means *heart*. By what it looks like, it's easy to see why it's called a heart-shaped curve. 

## The Heart of Mathematics
p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, and anyone else. 

This project is a visualisation of a cardioid using the JavaScript library p5.js with the main script in the [`sketch.js`](/the-heart-of-mathematics/sketch.js) JavaScript file.

The project was created with an extension in VSCode to setup a p5.js project with an [`index.html`](/the-heart-of-mathematics/index.html), a [`style.css`](/the-heart-of-mathematics/style.css) and a folder including the p5.js dependency libraries. The `sketch.js` is run using the *Live Server* extension on VSCode to start a `localhost:5000` server to host the script.
